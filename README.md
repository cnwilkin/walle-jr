Monitor the block chain for transactions on whale accounts

### TODO: 
- [x] Find 1 active account to monitor
  - FTX Exchange address: `0x2FAF487A4414Fe77e2327F0bf4AE2a264a776AD2` could be interesting
- [] Setup ganache and fork the mainnet for easier dev work
- [] Setup monitoring in console log
- [] Figure out if we can monitor mainnet directly or if we have to pay for that

### Longterm
- [] Setup scanner to locate active accounts over a threshold
- [] Store events
- [] Perform analysis on events
